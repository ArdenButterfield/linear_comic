# Linear Algebra Comics!

Back when I was taking linear algebra, I wrote some comics. 
I thought it could be fun to make a website for them. 
Perhaps there are some people out there who will understand and
appreciate the incredibly niche jokes I came up with.
Maybe you're one of those people.


Anyway, here's the code for that website. To view the website, run the program `flask_comic.py`. 
It is set up to run on port 5000.
