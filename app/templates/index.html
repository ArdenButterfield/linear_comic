        <h1>Linear Algebra Comics</h1>

        <p>I drew these comics in Fall of 2019 and Winter of 2020, during an (actually really good)
            linear algebra class. They sat in my notebooks for almost a year, until I decided others
            might find them funny, and so I made this website. Coding this website was my first real
            foray into HTML and CSS, and it has been a fun journey.</p>

        <p>In the fall, I mostly drew <a href="/more/">short comics</a>, relating to the day's lecture, or other things I
            thought were funny. I drew the (incredibly niche) <a href = "/parasite/">Linear Algebra Parasite</a>
            after seeing the film.</p>

        <p>Once winter term rolled around, I decided to tell a <a href = "/linear/">grander story</a>, spanning the entire term.
            It wouldnâ€™t try to <i>teach</i> linear algebra, but would instead use linear algebra as a
            framework upon which I would build the universe of the story. I started with the first panel,
            having no idea where the story would go, and made it up as I went along.</p>

        <p>And for those of you wondering, yes I did pass the class.</p>
